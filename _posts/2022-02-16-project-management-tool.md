Lets dive into each of the parameters.

## 🧠 Learning curve

- [Asana](https://asana.com/) :  It's an advance tool with lot of features that cater to complex workflows. Steep learning curve.
- [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) : It's also advanced tool with lot of features and not everyone is aware about it. Steep learning curve
- [Monday.com](https://monday.com/) : A tool more than project management. Lots of features makes learning steep
- [Github](https://github.com/features/issues) : Developer friendly tool, learning curve is not steep and easy to grasp. 

My choice : Github as its developer friendly.

## 🖇️ Flexibility

- [Asana](https://asana.com/) : Advanced tool with lot of customization available. UI/UX is bit outdated
- [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/): Advanced tool with good amount of customization and advanced UI/UX.

- [Github](https://github.com/features/issues) : Evolving tool with good amount of flexibility in creating boards, custom columns. Multiple board views. Easy integration with repositories

My Choice: Github due to multiple board views and customizable columns.

## 💰 Pricing

- [Github](https://github.com/features/issues) : Free(Unlimited members) and $4/month

My Choice: Github due to unlimited members in free tier.

## 📈 Scaling

- [Asana](https://asana.com/) : Scaling to large teams is expensive as advanced features are available in premium and enterprise ($10.99/$24.99 per month)
- [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/): Scaling to large teams is decently priced with good features available ($9/$19 per month)
- [Monday.com](https://monday.com/) : Good for scaling having great features and pricing ($10/ $16 per month)
- [Github](https://github.com/features/issues) : Highly scalable to large teams as seen with some of the large projects hosted and tracked through it with decent pricing ($21 per month)

My Choice: ClickUp

## Conclusion

We saw a brief comparison among different tools based on different parameters. When you are starting out on a project, all tools looks great but as the team grows, factors such as learning curve, pricing need to be evaluated. With the analysis presented I have chosen Github for my project management activity. Github has a fairly easy learning curve and comes with lot of flexibility making a good choice for developers. Overall my choice would be in the order of preference: Github > ClickUp > Asana > Monday.com. Any comments/suggestions/correction are welcome.
